# Example implementations of our laravel-server-side rendering package

This repo contains examples of server-side rendered JavaScript SPAs rendered in a Laravel application using our home grown [spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-server-side-rendering) package.

We've got a a `vue` + `vuex` + `vue-router` example and a very basic `react` + `react-router` example that will be expanded in the future.
